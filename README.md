# Project 3: Social Justice Festival Guide

# Project Overview
This project is a culmination of the skills developed throughout the semester of this introduction to web design course. I will be putting myself as an event organizer collaborating with a non profit organization of my choice, which will be the Filipino American Development Foundation. The goal is to highlihgt the causes and cultural significance of teh event by displaying events and activities people would want to do during the festival located in South Of Market, San Francisco (Decmeber 8-10th). I align myself with this cause because as a Filipino American, I have seen how history and systematic oppression has affect the Filipino American Community. I believe this website can be used in the future to actually promote events such as this. 

# Technical Overview
The project will involve translation of writtten word that describe the Filipino community into an interactive website. The site will use animations based off mouse hovering and scrolling. Users will be met with intricatet images and assets made from key frames that create responsive websites.
