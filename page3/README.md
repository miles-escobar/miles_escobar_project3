# Project 2: Words In Motion

## Project Overview
Community can mean alot of things. For me, I view community as the people you love and love you back. My community is my family, my girlfriend, and her family. The written word I chose that represnts that is "Glue Song" by Beabadoobee. For context, I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over 5 years. So overtime my family and her family have gotten very close and we consider our two families as one at this point. One line that highlights my community is 
"Im not wrong when I say I by the glue onto you" I want the audience to understand how close I am to my loved ones. And how this is really the only community that I have. 

## Technical Overview
Translate written word that describes community, into an interactice website, using animations based off mouse hovering and scrolling. There will be a specific area for the user to place their mouse, and they will be scrolling through a single colomn of words containing the lyrics to "Glue Song". Each word that is scrolled by will be relocated to the center of the screen to build the silhouette of a bottle of glue. The coding languages utilized are html and css. 

## Acknowledgment
